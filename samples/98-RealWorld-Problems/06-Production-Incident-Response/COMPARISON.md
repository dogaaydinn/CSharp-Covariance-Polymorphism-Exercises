# KARŞILAŞTIRMA: Incident Response Approaches

| Approach | MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|------------------------------|------|------------|
| **Manual** | 60-120 minutes | $0 | ⭐ |
| **Basic Monitoring** | 30-60 minutes | $100/mo | ⭐⭐ |
| **Automated** | 10-30 minutes | $500/mo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Self-Healing** | 1-10 minutes | $2000/mo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**ROI Calculation:**
- 1 hour downtime = $50,000 loss (typical)
- Automated monitoring cost = $500/month = $6,000/year
- Break-even: Prevent just 1 incident per year

**Verdict:** Automated monitoring pays for itself immediately!

**Industry Stats:**
- Average MTTR (2024): 
  - Startups: 120 minutes
  - Mid-size: 45 minutes
  - FAANG: 10 minutes
- Top 1% companies: <5 minutes MTTR (auto-remediation)

**Öneri:** Invest in monitoring/alerting EARLY (not after first incident!)

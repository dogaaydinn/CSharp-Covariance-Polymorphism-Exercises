# Project Title: Understanding Advanced C# Concepts

## About

In this project, I created various examples and applications to understand important concepts in the C# language. Below are the key topics covered in this project along with related questions:

- **Covariance and Contravariance**: Concepts related to type conversion in generic types, such as the ability to convert a subclass to a superclass type.
- **Boxing and Unboxing**: The process of converting value types to reference types and vice versa.
- **Polymorphism**: How methods can be redefined in different classes.
- **Type Conversion**: Methods of type conversion, including implicit (covert) and explicit (overt) conversions.
- **Generic Conversions**: Conversion processes for generic types.
- **Delegate and Array**: Usage and management of delegates and arrays.
- **Upcasting and Downcasting**: Type conversion between parent and child types.
- **Assignment Compatibility**: Compatibility of assignments between different types.

## Project Structure

This project is structured as a console application containing various examples related to the above topics. Each section includes classes and interfaces designed to explain a specific concept.

### Examples

1. **Polymorphism - Method Overriding**: Demonstrates polymorphism using the `Vehicle`, `Car`, and `Bike` classes.
2. **Upcasting and Downcasting**: Includes examples that examine conversions between the `Car` and `Vehicle` classes.
3. **Assignment Compatibility**: Explains assignment compatibility between `object` and `string` types.
4. **Covariance and Contravariance**: Provides examples of how to use generic interfaces.
5. **Explicit and Implicit Conversion**: Presents examples of implicit and explicit conversion with a `Temperature` class that converts temperature units.


## Conclusion
This project provides examples and applications that will help you understand complex concepts in the C# language. Explore how to use these concepts as you develop your code and deepen your understanding.

## Usage

To run your project, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open your C# development environment (e.g., Rider, Visual Studio or .NET CLI).
3. Open the project file and run it.
